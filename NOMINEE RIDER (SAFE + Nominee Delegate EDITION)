NOMINEE RIDER (SAFE EDITION)
This Rider is attached to and made part of the  SAFE (the “SAFE”) dated _____________ by and between _________________________ (“Company”) and _________________________, a ________ LLC (the “Nominee”).

1. Purpose and Beneficial Ownership
The parties acknowledge and agree that:
The Nominee is entering into the SAFE solely as the record holder and nominee on behalf of the members of the Nominee (the “Beneficial Owners”).


The Nominee does not possess any beneficial or economic ownership interest in the SAFE or any resulting Securities except as agent for the Beneficial Owners.


All rights to economic and beneficial ownership of the SAFE and any Securities issued upon conversion are held indirectly by the Beneficial Owners, through the Nominee.



2. Appointment of Nominee Delegate
The Beneficial Owners hereby appoint:
Nominee Delegate: ____________________________________ (the “Nominee Delegate”)
 Role: Authorized representative and limited attorney-in-fact for the Nominee, solely in connection with the SAFE.
The Nominee Delegate:
acts as the designated point of contact for the Company,


communicates with the Company on behalf of the Nominee,


provides or executes instructions and consents, and


performs administrative duties needed to give effect to this Rider.


The Nominee Delegate is not a beneficial owner by virtue of this role unless they separately hold membership in the Nominee.

3. Limited Power of Attorney
The Nominee Delegate is granted a revocable, limited power of attorney by the Nominee to:
Receive notices and communications from the Company;


Provide voting directions, consent rights, waivers, and acknowledgments as permitted under the SAFE;


Sign documents relating to amendments, conversions, or administrative matters of the SAFE;


Take ministerial actions required to preserve or administer the Nominee’s rights.


This authority:
must be exercised in a fiduciary and good-faith capacity,


is strictly limited to administration of the SAFE,


does not grant any ownership, economic, or discretionary control beyond what is stated herein.



4. Duty to Consult
The Nominee Delegate shall:
use best efforts to consult the Beneficial Owners (or an internal Investment Club voting representative structure) before providing any consent, waiver, or discretionary decision under the SAFE;


act with the intent to represent the collective, majority-expressed wishes of the Beneficial Owners;


keep reasonable records of votes or instructions obtained from Beneficial Owners.


Failure to consult despite best efforts does not invalidate the Nominee Delegate’s action if it was exercised in good faith and in the ordinary course of administrative necessity.

5. Economic Rights
The Nominee holds the SAFE strictly as agent. All economic benefits—including conversion equity, distributions, dividends, proceeds, or liquidity event returns—shall be:
received by the Nominee, and


distributed or allocated promptly and proportionately to the Beneficial Owners consistent with the Nominee’s operating agreement.


The Nominee Delegate does not receive any economic interest except to the extent they are separately a Beneficial Owner.

6. Voting and Consent Rights
Unless otherwise required by the Company or applicable law:
The Nominee Delegate may exercise any rights of the Nominee under the SAFE only in accordance with instructions given by the Beneficial Owners (majority vote, unless the Nominee’s operating agreement specifies otherwise).


If Beneficial Owners fail to deliver instructions within a reasonable period, the Nominee Delegate may act in good-faith administrative discretion to avoid prejudice or default.



7. Limitations on Authority
Neither the Nominee nor the Nominee Delegate may, without Beneficial Owner approval:
Transfer or assign the SAFE;


Pledge, encumber, or hypothecate the SAFE;


Modify the Ownership, economic rights, or allocations of Beneficial Owners;


Amend this Rider except as permitted in Section 14.


Any unauthorized actions are void as between the Nominee, Nominee Delegate, and the Beneficial Owners.

8. Replacement of Nominee Delegate
If the Nominee Delegate:
resigns,


becomes incapacitated, deceased, or unreachable,


fails to perform duties, or


is removed by vote of the Beneficial Owners,


then:
The Beneficial Owners may appoint a new Nominee Delegate at any time by simple majority vote (unless the Nominee’s operating agreement specifies a higher threshold).


The new appointment becomes effective once delivered to the Company in writing.


The Company may rely fully on the most recent written appointment provided.


This protects the Beneficial Owners and ensures continuity of representation.

9. Indemnification
The Beneficial Owners shall indemnify the Nominee and the Nominee Delegate for actions taken in good faith within the scope of this Rider, except for:
fraud,


willful misconduct, or


self-dealing.



10. Term and Termination
This Rider terminates upon the earliest of:
Transfer of the SAFE or conversion securities to the Beneficial Owners or an SPV successor;


Redemption, repurchase, or extinguishment of the SAFE;


Dissolution of the Nominee; or


Vote of the Beneficial Owners to terminate the nominee relationship.


Upon termination, the Nominee Delegate shall reasonably cooperate in transferring rights to the new holder.

11. Company Acknowledgment
The Company acknowledges that:
the Nominee is the sole record holder of the SAFE;


the Company may rely exclusively on communications from the Nominee Delegate unless otherwise notified in writing;


the internal relationship between the Nominee and Beneficial Owners does not obligate the Company except as explicitly stated.



12. Beneficial Owner Protections
This Rider shall not:
enlarge personal liability of Beneficial Owners,


create personal guarantees, or


create joint and several liability among members of the Investment Club.


The Nominee and Nominee Delegate act solely as administrative agents.

13. Governing Law
This Rider shall be governed by the laws of the State of ____________________.

14. Miscellaneous
This Rider forms an integral part of the SAFE and controls in case of conflict as between the Nominee, Nominee Delegate, and Beneficial Owners.


Amendments require majority Beneficial Owner approval.


Electronic signatures and PDF execution are valid.
