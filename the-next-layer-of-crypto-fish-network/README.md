<p align="center">Why does Crypto keep failing?</p>

**The main answer** is integration of crypto chain systems into our current financial infrastructure have been in large part about currency creation, not smart contract creation.&#x20;

Smart contracts matter more than speculative cryptocurrencies. When capital allocation is structured through programmable rules instead of speculative tokens, entirely new economic structures emerge.&#x20;

Can we invent new Onchain capital allocation strategies that were not possible before Ethereum, that bring our financial system and our markets into a new era?
