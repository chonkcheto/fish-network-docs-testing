# Rule Creation on Crypto Assets

### In a smart contract–based investment/raising platform, rules are part of the asset itself, not external agreements.

_This is where the user experience diverges, dramatically._

#### Imagine, your Bank Account, but with a Library of Functions (rules that can be built on and around it):

* **Access & Governance**<br>
  * Multi-signature approval (e.g., 3 of 5 investors must agree).<br>
  * Weighted voting (based on capital or reputation points).<br>
* **Funding Mechanics**<br>
  * Minimum/maximum raise thresholds (escrow releases only if $1M target hit).<br>
  * Milestone-based disbursement (funds released in stages).<br>
* **Liquidity Rules**<br>
  * Lockup windows (3 weeks, 6 months, 1 year).<br>
  * Redemption rights (withdraw anytime with penalty vs. only after milestone).<br>
* **Distribution Rules**<br>
  * Auto-splits across multiple recipients.<br>
  * Streaming payouts (continuous interest/royalty drip).<br>
* **Compliance Rules**<br>
  * KYC/KYB gating before funds are accepted.<br>
  * Geo-blocking (deny deposits from restricted jurisdictions).<br>

:white\_check\_mark: Compare this with Capital One or Robinhood: you don’t get to write the rules. You can only use the ones they’ve predefined — “buy,” “sell,” “transfer,” “schedule a payment.”
