# Governing Money (Smart Contract Model)

In a smart contract environment, the rules are embedded directly into the money’s movement. The contract doesn’t just authorize; it executes.

Examples:

* Escrow without a middleman: Money can be locked into a contract that only releases once both buyer and seller digitally confirm the delivery. No lawyer, no escrow agent, no court.\
  <br>
* Automatic revenue shares: A payment can be coded to automatically split — 50% to you, 30% to a partner, 20% to taxes — with no manual intervention.\
  <br>
* Milestone-based funding: A $1M investment can sit in a contract that releases $200k chunks only when agreed KPIs are uploaded and verified.\
  <br>

Here, the capital is not just waiting for you to push it around. It’s carrying instructions, conditions, and governance logic inside itself.
