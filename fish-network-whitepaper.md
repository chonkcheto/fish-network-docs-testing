# Fish Network Whitepaper

Version 1.0 | December 2025

***

### Executive Summary

Fish Network is reimagining early-stage capital formation by replacing inefficient centralized crowdfunding portals with decentralized Fish Schools - community-driven investment clubs that combine expert curation with collective decision-making, all powered by blockchain infrastructure.

As communities scale, governance and diligence become the bottleneck. Fish AI Agents convert passive investors into active contributors by compressing diligence time, organizing discussions, and enabling voice-confirmed voting—improving decision quality while keeping the system squarely within the parameters of an SEC recognized investment club.

#### The Problem

Traditional crowdfunding platforms charge excessive fees (up to 10% of assets under management), suffer from adverse selection as high-quality companies avoid them, and offer investors little liquidity or transparency. Meanwhile, venture capital remains concentrated among a small number of firms, limiting access for both investors and founders.

#### Our Solution

Fish Network enables investors to form thesis-driven communities called Fish Schools - legally compliant investment clubs where capital is pooled upfront, startups compete for funding through community votes, and transparency is enforced through smart contracts on Coinbase's Base Layer 2 blockchain.

#### Agentic AI Layer

Fish Network includes an agentic AI layer that reduces participation friction while preserving investment-club requirements for active member involvement. Voice and chat-based assistants help members review opportunities, ask questions, and cast consent-based votes; social distribution agents help Fish School Organizers communicate thesis, updates, and due diligence to existing communities without general solicitation. The AI layer is designed to increase informed participation—not replace individual decision-making.

#### Key Innovation

Unlike traditional syndicate models where investors commit per deal, Fish Schools operate with pre-funded capital pools. This eliminates deal-by-deal friction, ensures serious commitment, and allows organizers to move quickly when opportunities arise. This provides investors with a more capital efficient deployment mechanism, that can help facilitate any type of social capital formation.

#### Market Opportunity

With over $10 billion in USDC on the Base network alone, Fish Network targets just 1% market penetration to achieve $100 million in Total Value Locked. As the billion-dollar small team era accelerates, efficient capital formation infrastructure becomes critical for both founders and investors.

#### Vision

Today, Fish Network provides the comprehensive framework for emerging managers to scale US based community-driven venture capital. Tomorrow, Fish Network has the opportunity to become the global operating system for democratized early-stage investing, designed for the average retail investor. By providing a different set of tradeoffs between **liquidity, optionality, and diversification**, Fish Network provides global access to US private markets using transparent and compliant on-chain systems, coupled with existing custody and identity verification solutions.

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 The Billion-Dollar Small Team Era

Over the past decade, technology has enabled increasingly small teams to build billion-dollar companies. What once required hundreds of employees and years of infrastructure buildout can now be accomplished by fewer than a dozen founders and operators, leveraging AI, cloud computing, and blockchain technology.

This shift creates both opportunity and challenge:

Opportunity: More founders can build transformative companies with less capital\
Challenge: Traditional venture capital and fundraising infrastructure wasn't designed for this velocity

#### 1.2 The Capital Formation Gap

Despite technological progress, the infrastructure for matching capital with innovation remains antiquated:

* Venture Capital: Highly concentrated, with top-tier firms receiving thousands of applications for limited spots
* Crowdfunding Portals: Burdened by high fees, poor match quality, and limited liquidity
* Angel Networks: Fragmented, relationship-dependent, and geographically constrained

Fish Network bridges this gap by creating scalable, transparent, and community-driven investment infrastructure built for the modern era.

#### 1.3 Total Addressable Market

Alternative Investments Market:

* Global alternative investments: $13.7 trillion AUM (2024)
* Private equity: $5.8 trillion
* Venture capital: $1.1 trillion
* Target: <1% of VC market = $11 billion TAM

Crowdfunding Market:

* U.S. equity crowdfunding: $1.5 billion raised in 2024
* Compound annual growth rate: 16% (2020-2024)
* Reg CF limit increase to $5M (2021) drove significant growth
* Fish Network positioned to capture majority of future growth

Crypto Capital Formation:

* $19.6 billion raised via crypto VC deals in 2024
* Base L2 ecosystem: $10+ billion TVL
* Target: 1% of Base USDC = $100 million TVL
* Expanding to other L2s and chains over time

***

### 2. The Broken State of Crowdfunding

#### 2.1 Platform Economics Are Misaligned

Traditional equity crowdfunding platforms operate on a pay-to-list model, charging startups upfront fees plus ongoing compliance costs that can reach 10% of assets under management. This creates adverse selection: high-quality companies avoid these platforms, leaving lower-signal deals to dominate supply.

Result: Investors lose trust, participation drops, and the entire ecosystem stagnates.

#### 2.2 Investor Experience Is Poor

Current crowdfunding platforms offer investors:

* Limited transparency into deal quality and due diligence processes
* Uncertain liquidity with 7-10 year lockup periods and no secondary markets
* High friction in decision-making, requiring commitment before seeing the full opportunity set
* No community alignment or collective wisdom in investment decisions

#### 2.3 Founders Face Structural Disadvantages

Startups seeking capital through existing platforms encounter:

* High costs that dilute their runway before they even begin building
* Adverse selection stigma from appearing on platforms known for lower-quality deals
* Slow processes that can take months to close even small rounds
* Limited value-add beyond capital, with no engaged community support

#### 2.4 Why Hasn't This Been Fixed?

Traditional platforms are constrained by:

1. Technology limitations - paper-based processes that don't scale
2. Regulatory complexity - compliance frameworks built for analog era
3. Business model incentives - revenue tied to transaction fees, not outcomes
4. Network effects - no single platform has achieved sufficient liquidity

Fish Network addresses each of these constraints through blockchain infrastructure, modern compliance frameworks, and aligned incentive structures.

***

### 3. Fish Network Solution

#### 3.1 Core Innovation: Fish Schools

A Fish School is a community-driven investment club structured as a Series LLC, where:

1. Capital is pooled upfront by investors who share an investment thesis
2. Expert organizers curate and vet deal flow in their domain of expertise
3. Community members vote on which startups receive funding
4. Smart contracts enforce transparency, automate distributions, and track reputation
5. Legal compliance is built-in through proper entity structure and regulatory adherence

#### 3.2 How Fish Schools Work

**Capital Allocation Model — “80/20 Micro-Fund” (points + front-loaded admin fees)**

**Use Cases:** Investment Clubs and SPVs as Fish Schools; capital is raised prior to deployment.

* Best for: early pilots, fast launches, low complexity
* **≥80%** deployed to investments
* **≤20%** for admin/ops and early execution costs (front-loaded)

Formation Phase:

* Vetted Fish School Organizer creates a new school with specific investment thesis (e.g., "DeFi Infrastructure on Base" or "AI-Powered Consumer Apps")
* Organizer establishes Series LLC entity with proper legal documentation
* Investment parameters are set: minimum/maximum school size, investment criteria, governance rules

Funding Phase:

* Investors undergo KYC/KYB through Coinbase or Kraken infrastructure
* Capital contributions are made in USDC
* Funds flow to qualified custody (Coinbase Prime/Kraken) for security
* Smart contracts on Base L2 manage escrow and routing

Investment Phase:

* Organizer sources and vets startup opportunities
* Qualified startups pitch to Fish School community
* Members review materials, ask questions, conduct diligence
* Community votes onchain using earned Fish Points for governance weight
* Winning startups receive immediate capital deployment

Distribution + Portfolio Support Phase:

* Portfolio companies achieve liquidity events (acquisition, IPO, secondary sales)
* Proceeds flow back through smart contracts
* Automated distribution to Fish School members proportional to ownership
* Fish Points rewards for successful picks, building member reputation

**Future Use Case:** Rolling "funds" as investment clubs

#### 3.3 Fish School Fee Structure

No Pay-to-List:\
Unlike traditional crowdfunding platforms, Fish Network does not charge startups upfront listing fees. This ensures high-quality deal flow and removes adverse selection.

Platform Economics:

For Fish Schools (Organizers):

* 0% formation fee to create a new Fish School
* Fish Reputation Points are accrued
* Fish must vote and collectively agree on any at-cost compensation

For Fish Network (Platform):

* 1% platform fee on capital deployed to startups
* 0.5% secondary market fee on liquidity transactions (future)
* 1-3% withdrawal fee(future) based on lockup period
* Premium features for enterprise Fish Schools (analytics, white-label, API access)

For Investors:

* No subscription fees to join Fish Schools
* No performance fees to Fish Network (only to organizers if applicable)
* Gas fees only for on-chain transactions (minimal on Base L2)

#### 3.4 Key Differentiators

Instead of CrowdSAFEs, which strip investors of voting rights(similar to traditional SPVs), Fish Network introduces a nominee structure to streamline admin, and a nominee delegate(typically an individual) to simplify accountability, distribute workload, and give power to the "fish."

Furthermore, Fish Network provides its Fish Schools with a built-in [Nominee Rider side letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aEJiINeprfwtibHhGJa-JXveAWzKpNGcymzFsiwh2Eo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.i4qdgr3pksx1), to provide more governance protections to the Fish, such as information and pro-rata rights.

| **Traditional Crowdfunding Platform** | **Fish Network**                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Pay-to-list fees (\~10%)              | No listing fees                      |
| One-off commitment per deal           | Pre-funded capital pools             |
| Limited transparency                  | Fully onchain voting & distributions |
| 7-10 year illiquidity                 | Semi-liquid with redemption windows  |
| Platform curates deals                | Community curates deals              |



| **Traditional VC**          | **Fish Network**            |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Concentrated ownership      | Distributed from day one    |
| $100K+ minimum checks       | $100+ minimum investment    |
| Requires warm introductions | Open application process    |
| GP makes all decisions      | Community governance        |
| Limited fund sizes          | Unlimited scaling potential |

vs. Syndicate Platforms:

| **Syndicate Model**      | **Fish Network**            |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Deal-by-deal fundraising | Pre-funded pools            |
| Uncertain close amounts  | Known capital availability  |
| High deal friction       | Rapid deployment            |
| Informal structures      | Legally compliant entities  |
| Leader carries all risk  | Distributed decision-making |

#### 3.5 The Fish Network Flywheel

1. Organizers create Fish Schools focused on specific theses or sectors
2. Investors join schools aligned with their interests and expertise
3. Startups pitch to relevant Fish Schools, competing for capital
4. Community votes fund the best opportunities quickly
5. Successful investments create returns and reputation (Fish Points)
6. Top performers attract more capital and better deal flow
7. Network effects strengthen as ecosystem grows

This creates a virtuous cycle where quality begets quality, and the platform becomes increasingly valuable to all participants.

***

### 4. Technical Architecture

#### 4.1 Blockchain Infrastructure

Fish Network is built on Coinbase's Base Layer 2, an Ethereum-compatible blockchain optimized for consumer applications. Base provides:

* Low transaction costs for frequent voting and governance actions
* High throughput to support thousands of concurrent Fish Schools
* EVM compatibility enabling integration with DeFi ecosystem
* Coinbase integration for seamless fiat onramps and custody

#### 4.2 Smart Contract Architecture

Core Contracts:

FishSchool.sol - Master contract for each investment club

* Manages member registry and permissions
* Tracks capital contributions and ownership percentages
* Enforces governance rules and voting mechanisms
* In the future liquidity model, routes capital according to a 50/40/10 split
* Handles distributions from liquidity events

FishEscrow.sol - Secure capital custody during evaluation period

* Holds 50% of contributions in 21-day escrow window
* Accrues Fish Points for depositors during lock period
* Releases capital to voted startups after community decision
* Implements emergency pause and recovery functions

FishPoints.sol - Reputation and governance token

* ERC-20 compatible but non-transferable (soulbound)
* Earned through capital contribution, voting participation, and successful picks
* Used for governance weight in investment decisions
* Tracks onchain reputation and contribution history

FishGovernance.sol - Voting and proposal management

* Creates investment proposals for startup funding
* Manages voting periods and quorum requirements
* Weights votes by Fish Points holdings
* Executes approved proposals automatically
* Records all votes onchain for transparency

FishRegistry.sol - Platform-wide coordination

* Maintains list of all active Fish Schools
* Tracks organizer credentials and reputation
* Enforces platform-wide parameters and limits
* Enables cross-school analytics and reporting
* Manages protocol fees and treasury

FishAgentRouter (Optional Module / Interface Layer)

* A standardized interface for AI-assisted workflows (summaries, consent-hash logging, vote execution requests)
* The router enforces that only KYC-attested wallets can submit binding actions and can require consent-hash proofs prior to vote execution

#### 4.3 Custody & Security

Qualified Custody: All investor funds are held in qualified custody through Slash, Coinbase Prime or Kraken institutional services, ensuring:

* Institutional-grade security
* Regulatory compliance for investment advisors
* Insurance coverage for digital assets
* Segregated accounts per Fish School
* Audit trails for all movements

Smart Contract Security:

* Contracts follow OpenZeppelin standards
* Multi-signature controls on critical functions
* Time-locks on parameter changes
* Emergency pause mechanisms
* Regular security audits by third-party firms

#### 4.4 Identity & Compliance Infrastructure

Fish Network performs direct KYC/AML checks on each Fish School Organizer prior to capital deployment. Fish Network also provides tools on platform to enable Fish School Organizers to KYC its members. However, Fish School Organizers are responsible for enforcing their own individual KYC policies.

**Compliance automation features included:**

* Onchain attestations - Verified credentials stored as soulbound tokens
* Privacy-preserving - Minimal data exposure while maintaining compliance
* Automated accredited investor verification
* Real-time transaction monitoring for suspicious activity
* Automated reporting for SEC Form C filings
* Cap table management and ownership tracking
* Tax document generation (K-1s, 1099s)

**Third Party Integrations:**

* cb.id - Coinbase's on-chain identity system for investors
* Kraken verification - Institutional-grade KYB for Fish School entities
* KYC/KYB/AML provider: [Simplici](https://simplici.io/)

#### 4.5 Interoperability & Extensibility

Fish Network smart contracts are designed for composability:

* ERC-4626 tokenized vaults for Fish School shares (future enhancement)
* Integration hooks for DeFi protocols (lending, derivatives)
* Oracle support for off-chain data (startup valuations, liquidity events)
* Cross-chain messaging for multi-chain expansion
* Open APIs for third-party tools and analytics

#### **4.6 Agentic AI Layer**&#x20;

Fish Network provides an agentic AI system (“Fish Agents”) that supports investors, organizers, and startups across the full lifecycle of a Fish School. Fish Agents reduce the overhead of participating in governance and diligence while ensuring that final actions—especially votes and binding decisions—remain attributable to individually verified members.

**Fish Agent Types**

* **Voting Agent (Voice + Chat):** Guides verified members through proposals, confirms intent, and executes on-chain voting transactions only after explicit user consent and wallet signature.
* **Diligence Q\&A Agent:** Operates as a structured question-and-answer layer for each startup and proposal, indexing uploaded materials (pitch deck, data room summaries, legal docs, traction metrics) and producing verifiable citations to source documents.
* **Community Discussion Agent:** Moderates and summarizes school discussions, surfaces unanswered diligence questions, identifies consensus points and disagreement areas, and generates daily/weekly “governance briefings” for members.
* **Organizer Social Agent:** Generates compliant communications for Fish School Organizers (FSOs) to distribute thesis updates, calls-to-action (e.g., “vote by Friday”), and post-investment reporting to their existing community channels.
* **Startup Update Agent:** Helps portfolio startups draft structured investor updates (monthly metrics, milestones, risks, asks) and routes questions back to founders in an organized queue.

**Consent, Identity, and Auditability**\
All agentic interactions that result in governance or capital-routing actions require:

1. verified identity (KYC/KYB),
2. an explicit user confirmation step (voice or text), and
3. a cryptographic signature by the user’s wallet.\
   The system may store a hash of the consent transcript and link it to the corresponding on-chain transaction for auditability.

**Compliance-First Design**\
Fish Agents are designed to increase active participation by reducing friction (reading time, coordination cost, execution complexity). They do not remove responsibility from individual members and do not autonomously manage pooled assets.

***

### 5. Future Economic Model

#### 5.1 Liquidity in Private Markets

In the future, Fish Schools will be able to opt-in(via a governance vote) to deploy their previously locked "Liquidity Premium" to facilitate early liquidity for investors.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**FUTURE MODEL: — “50/40/10 Split” (escrow + tokenized investment club equity)**

* 50% → Smart contract escrow earning stablecoin yield; comprehensive liquidity for all fish schools
* 40% → Distributed to winning startup(s) based on community vote
  * earning Fish Points during 21-day evaluation window
* 10% → Fish School treasury for operations, legal, and administration

**Tradeoff:** Enables 1:1 withdrawal functionality, but more capital is tied up in stablecoins.

**Liquidity:** Shared liquidity layer enables early redemptions (subject to fees/lockups per school)

#### 5.2 Capital Flow

Investor Contribution → Fish School:

* Investor commits USDC to join Fish School
* Funds flow to qualified custody (Coinbase/Kraken)
* Smart contract records ownership and mints Fish Points
* Capital enters 21-day evaluation/escrow period

Fish School → Startup Investment:

* Community votes to allocate capital to winning startup(s)
* 40% of school capital deployed automatically via smart contract
* Startup receives investment in USDC
* Fish School receives equity stake (tokenized or traditional cap table entry)

Startup → Liquidity Event → Distribution:

* Portfolio company achieves exit (acquisition, IPO, secondary sale)
* Proceeds converted to USDC and returned to Fish School smart contract
* Automatic pro-rata distribution to all Fish School members
* Organizer receives performance-based compensation from treasury
* Successful voters earn bonus Fish Points for picking winners

#### **5.3 Liquidity Mechanisms**

Fish Network is designed to provide **semi-liquid exposure** to fundamentally illiquid venture assets through structured liquidity coordination, rather than promising continuous liquidity. Liquidity is explicitly priced, gated, and governed to preserve capital integrity while improving flexibility relative to traditional venture funds and syndicates.

#### **5.3.1 Primary Liquidity — Redemption Windows**

Fish Schools may offer liquidity through **scheduled redemption windows**, subject to disclosed school-specific terms.

**Standard Characteristics:**

* **Redemption cadence:** Periodic (e.g., monthly or quarterly), as defined by each Fish School
* **Minimum notice period:** Typically three (3) weeks
* **Lockups:** Some Fish Schools may impose extended lockups of up to one (1) year, disclosed prior to contribution
* **NAV reference:** Redemptions are processed based on the most recent portfolio valuation methodology adopted by the school

Redemptions are honored only during designated windows and may be limited or deferred to preserve fairness across members and avoid forced asset sales.

***

#### **5.3.2 Shared Liquidity Layer — Network Coordination**

Fish Network coordinates liquidity across multiple Fish Schools through a **shared liquidity layer**, designed to smooth redemption demand and reduce idiosyncratic liquidity risk at the individual school level.

**Key Properties:**

* Liquidity is **coordinated, not guaranteed**
* Redemptions may be satisfied through cross-school matching, reserve capital, or structured netting mechanisms
* Shared liquidity improves capital efficiency without requiring immediate liquidation of underlying portfolio assets

This approach allows Fish Network to provide earlier or partial liquidity in some cases while preserving long-term upside for remaining participants.

***

#### **5.3.3 Liquidity Premium — Explicit Pricing of Liquidity (Default: 5%)**

To bootstrap and maintain shared liquidity, Fish Network may apply a **Liquidity Premium** to capital contributions.

**Definition:**\
The Liquidity Premium is a **non-refundable percentage of contributed capital (default 5%)** allocated to a protocol-level liquidity contract (the **FishLP Contract**).

**Purpose:**

* Build and grow Total Value Locked (TVL) at the network level
* Support redemption coordination without forced asset sales
* Explicitly price liquidity access rather than socializing liquidity risk implicitly
* Create a durable liquidity backstop benefiting all Fish Schools over time

**Mechanics:**

* The Liquidity Premium is deducted at contribution
* Premium capital is routed automatically, on-chain, into the Open General Contract
* Capital in the Open General Contract is subject to longer lockups and protocol-level governance
* Liquidity Premium capital does **not** represent ownership in any single Fish School portfolio

**Applicability:**

* The Liquidity Premium may apply to **all Fish Schools by default**
* The premium may be **mandatory or increased** for:
  * Fish Schools launched **off-platform**
  * Fish Schools operating **outside the United States**
  * Fish Schools opting into enhanced or accelerated liquidity features

Liquidity Premium rates may be adjusted over time based on network conditions and are disclosed prior to contribution.

***

#### **5.3.4 Liquidity Haircuts — Network Resilience Mechanism (Future / Conditional)**

In addition to the Liquidity Premium, Fish Network reserves the right to apply **Liquidity Haircuts** under specific circumstances.

**Definition:**\
A Liquidity Haircut is a **one-time allocation of capital (anticipated range: 5%–20%)** from Fish Schools to the Open General Contract to reinforce shared liquidity.

**Potential Triggers:**

* Network-wide liquidity stress events
* Introduction of new shared liquidity mechanisms or redemption facilities
* Major protocol upgrades or economic transitions
* Regulatory or jurisdictional changes requiring additional liquidity buffers

**Characteristics:**

* Liquidity Haircuts are **not routine fees**
* Any haircut would be:
  * Applied uniformly or by disclosed class of Fish Schools
  * Executed transparently via on-chain routing
  * Allocated to shared liquidity rather than platform revenue

This mechanism is disclosed in advance to preserve long-term flexibility and avoid retroactive economic changes.

***

#### **5.3.5 Liquidity Tradeoffs and User Expectations**

Fish Network does not promise continuous liquidity. Instead, it provides **structured optionality** with clear tradeoffs:

* Liquidity access may reduce deployable capital to individual Fish Schools
* Earlier liquidity may be subject to discounts, premiums, or haircuts
* Long-term participants benefit from shared liquidity growth and network effects

By pricing liquidity explicitly and coordinating it at the network level, Fish Network aims to deliver a more flexible and resilient alternative to traditional venture lockups—without misrepresenting the inherently illiquid nature of early-stage investments.

***

#### 5.4 Value Capture & Sustainability

Network Effects:

* More Fish Schools → more deal flow → better opportunities → more investors
* More investors → more capital → better terms → more startups
* More successful exits → more reputation (Fish Points) → higher quality participants

Future Monetization Paths:

1. Transaction fees on capital deployment (1% baseline)
2. Management fees on platform treasury and services (2% annual)
3. Premium services for organizers (analytics, marketing, legal templates)
4. Data licensing (anonymized deal flow and performance metrics)
5. Secondary market fees when liquidity mechanisms launch

Long-term Sustainability: Platform is designed to be capital-efficient and self-sustaining through fees that align with user success rather than extractive rent-seeking.

Fish Network brings targeted advantages for angel investors and emerging managers through compliant, tokenized crowdfunding and AI-driven deal matching. This positions Fish Network to capture significant share in VC, equity crowdfunding, and crypto ecosystems.

***

### 7. Legal & Compliance Framework

#### 7.1 Entity Structure ![](<.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

Upon approval of an investment proposal, the platform executes the investment using a **nominee-based structure** that mimics a traditional CrowdSAFE instrument, but instead gives investors voting rights, amongst other protections, upon a trigger event that warrants a conversion into traditional equity.

* **Nominee:** A Fish School LLC(typically the Master, but can be the individual Series) that holds legal title to the investment on behalf of all Fish Schools and their respective members.
* **Beneficial Owners:** Individual Fish School Series LLC retains beneficial ownership interests.
* **Nominee Delegate:** An individual, typically the Fish School Organizer or Deal Champion, authorized to execute administrative, contractual, and issuer-facing actions on behalf of the Nominee.
  * Required to represent the majority voting interest of its Fish School members

The Nominee Delegate is obligated to:

* broadcast governance proposals and voting outcomes to Fish School members, and
* execute investment decisions in accordance with the majority vote of the Fish School, as determined through reputation-weighted on-chain governance.

This structure simplifies administrative execution while preserving investor voting rights and accountability, distinguishing the system from traditional SPVs and CrowdSAFE-based structures that centralize control.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Each Fish School operates as a Series LLC with the following characteristics:

* Limited Liability: Protects members from personal liability beyond their investment
* Series Structure: Each Fish School is legally separate from others and the platform
* Pass-through Taxation: Avoids double taxation; members report on personal returns
* Investment Club Model: Collective decision-making avoids GP/advisor regulations

Each Fish School has the following set of Organizational Documents:

**1) Required:** Operating Agreement defining governance, basic voting parameters, and profit distributions

* Optional: Bylaws establishing custom voting procedures and company specific decision rules

**2) Required:** Membership Admission Agreement for new member onboarding

**3) Recommended:** Investment Policy Statement outlining thesis and criteria for investments

#### 7.2 Securities Regulation Compliance

**7.2.1:** **Investment Clubs**

&#x20;Clubs are generally unregulated by the SEC as long as they maintain the below characteristics throughout the lifecycle of operation.

* No Passive Members
  * **Fish Network:** All members must vote over both governance and investment decisions or they risk involuntary termination and/or reputation penalties
* No General Solicitation
  * **Fish Network:** Investment Clubs do not have a public facing website; instead they create a Fish School on Fish Network platform and bring their existing social capital.
* No Management Fees or Carried Interest
  * **Fish Network:** Fish vote and approve any administrative expenses, including Fish School Organizer compensation. Any compensation is valued at-cost, and does not imply fiduciary duty.
* No Promotion or Endorsement of Securities
  * **Fish Network:** Fish School Organizers only promote their thesis and are not compensated by issuers; deals are chosen post-funding.
* Must have 99 members or less
  * **Fish Network:** Fish School smart contracts are limited to a 99 member maximum.

Investment Limits (Non-Accredited): Varies State by State in the USA.

**7.2.2: Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF):**

Fish Schools raise capital under SEC Regulation Crowdfunding, enabling:

* $1.07 million maximum per 12-month period per Fish School(not subject to audit)
* $5 million maximum per 12-month period per Fish School(subject to audit)
* Accredited investors have no investment limits
* Form C filing with SEC before offering begins
* Ongoing reporting requirements (annual financials, material changes)
* Non-accredited investors can participate subject to investment limits
  * If annual income or net worth < $124,000: Greater of $2,500 or 5% of lesser amount
  * If annual income and net worth ≥ $124,000: 10% of lesser amount, up to $124,000

**7.2.3 :** **Regulation D:** Accredited Investor verification for SPVs only.

* **Fish Network:** On-chain verification through [Metalex](https://metalex-docs.vercel.app/cyberdeals/lexchex) infrastructure

### 9. Fish Points: Reputation & Rewards

#### 9.1 Design Principles

Fish Points serve as a reputation and governance token designed to:

1. Reward participation - Incentivize active engagement in Fish Schools
2. Weight governance - Give more influence to proven contributors
3. Build reputation - Create portable onchain track record
4. Align incentives - Encourage quality over quantity in decision-making
5. Enable meritocracy - Let performance speak louder than capital size

Key Characteristics:

* Non-transferable (Soulbound): Cannot be bought, sold, or transferred
* Earned, not purchased: Acquired only through platform participation
* Onchain and verifiable: Transparent history of all accruals
* Cross-school portable: Reputation follows user across Fish Schools
* Decaying over time: Encourages ongoing participation vs. resting on laurels

#### 9.2 How Fish Points Are Earned

Capital Contribution:

* Base accrual rate: 1 Fish Point per $1 contributed to Fish School escrow
* Accrued during 21-day escrow period before capital deploys
* Lockup bonus: Additional points for longer commitment periods
* Early supporter bonus: Extra points for joining new Fish Schools

Voting Participation:

* 10 Fish Points per vote cast on investment decisions
* Bonus for detailed feedback and due diligence contributions
* Streak bonuses for consistent voting participation
* Quality bonus if vote aligns with majority (reduces gaming)

Successful Picks:

* 100 Fish Points when portfolio company achieves positive exit (>2x return)
* 250 Fish Points for exceptional exits (>5x return)
* Proportional to ownership and investment performance
* Distributed at liquidity event, not mark-to-market

Community Contributions:

* Sourcing winning deals: 200 Fish Points per successful referral
* Quality due diligence: Up to 50 Fish Points for detailed analysis
* Mentoring startups: Points for value-add beyond capital
* Platform improvements: Rewards for bug reports, feature suggestions

#### 9.3 Fish Points Utility

Governance Weight:

* Voting power in Fish School decisions weighted by Fish Points
* Prevents whale dominance (capital alone doesn't rule)
* Gives proven performers more influence
* Encourages long-term engagement

Access & Privileges:

* Tier 1 (0-1,000 points): Access to basic Fish Schools
* Tier 2 (1,000-10,000 points): Access to premium schools and early deal flow
* Tier 3 (10,000+ points): Eligibility to become Fish School Organizer
* Tier 4 (50,000+ points): Shoal Leader opportunities and platform governance

Reputation & Signaling:

* Portable reputation across DeFi and Web3
* Proof of sophistication for future opportunities

Future Utility (Roadmap):

* Discounts on platform fees for high Fish Points holders
* Priority access to oversubscribed Fish Schools
* Governance rights over Fish Network platform decisions
* Potential token conversion if Fish Network issues governance token&#x20;
* AI-Assisted Participation: \
  Fish Points may be awarded for AI-assisted governance actions that still require individual consent. This reinforces active participation while reducing the friction of traditional governance workflows.

#### 9.4 Anti-Gaming Mechanisms

Instead of using typical crypto staking mechanisms which invite manipulation, we avoid these problems by forcing all participants to vote; the majority must agree on the use of capital. Each member receives a governance stake proportional to the capital they invest in the fish school.

Sybil Resistance:

* KYC/KYB requirements prevent multiple identities
* Non-transferable design prevents Fish Points markets
* Capital contribution minimums prevent spam accounts

Quality Filters:

* Time delays between actions prevent rapid farming
* Decay mechanisms reduce inactive user balances
* Vote alignment bonuses reward thoughtful decisions
* Penalty for pattern of poor performance (consistent losses)

Economic Security:

* Fish Points have no monetary value and cannot be sold
* Governance decisions still require capital at risk
* Platform can adjust earning rates to maintain balance
* Emergency ability to reset or adjust gaming accounts

***

#### 10.1 Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC)

Fish Network implements comprehensive AML/KYC procedures through a Customer Identification Program (CIP) including ongoing monitoring.

Technology Partners: Compliance infrastructure provided through Coinbase and Kraken reduces Fish Network's operational burden while maintaining regulatory standards.

#### 10.2 Custody & Financial Regulations

Qualified Custody Rule:

To comply with SEC custody requirements for investment advisors:

* All investor funds held at qualified custodians (Coinbase Prime, Kraken)
* Independent verification of holdings
* Direct delivery of account statements to investors
* Surprise examinations by independent auditors

Smart Contract Limitations:

While smart contracts automate certain functions, they do not constitute custody. Actual digital assets remain with regulated custodians, and smart contracts serve as:

* Routing mechanisms for approved transactions
* Governance and voting infrastructure
* Record-keeping and transparency layer

#### 10.3 Tax Considerations

Pass-Through Structure:

Fish Schools are structured as pass-through entities:

* No entity-level taxation on Fish Schools
* Members receive K-1 forms annually
* Capital gains, losses, and income flow through to member tax returns
* Each member's tax treatment depends on individual circumstances

Fish Points Tax Treatment:

Fish Points are designed as non-transferable reputation tokens:

* No immediate tax event upon receipt
* Not treated as income when earned
* May have tax implications if future liquidity is introduced
* Members should consult tax advisors for specific situations

Reporting:

Platform provides:

* Annual K-1 forms for Fish School members
* 1099 forms for certain distributions
* Transaction history for tax preparation
* Integration with crypto tax software (CoinTracker, TaxBit)

#### 10.4 Risk Disclosures

All Fish School investors receive comprehensive risk disclosures:

* Loss of Capital: Venture investments are high-risk; total loss possible
* Illiquidity: Limited ability to exit investments before liquidity events
* Dilution: Portfolio companies may raise additional capital, diluting ownership
* Regulatory Changes: Evolving crypto and securities regulations may impact operations
* Smart Contract Risks: Technology risks including bugs, exploits, or failures
* Custody Risks: Despite qualified custodians, digital asset theft remains possible
* AI and Automation Risk: Fish Network’s AI-assisted interfaces may introduce risks including inaccurate summaries, misinterpretation of intent, or operational errors; therefore, binding actions require explicit user confirmation and wallet signatures, and users remain responsible for their decisions.

### 12. Conclusion

#### 12.1 The Opportunity

We stand at an inflection point. Technology has enabled smaller teams to achieve outsized outcomes, yet the infrastructure for matching capital with innovation remains rooted in analog processes, misaligned incentives, and unnecessary intermediaries.

Fish Network solves this by creating transparent, community-driven investment infrastructure built on blockchain rails. By pre-funding capital pools, distributing decision-making, and enforcing transparency through smart contracts, we eliminate the friction that has plagued both founders and investors.

#### 12.2 Why Now

Three converging trends make Fish Network possible today:

1. Regulatory Clarity: Reg CF and investment club structure provides a compliant path for community capital formation
   1. Potential for looming change in accreditation laws to streamline retail participation in private markets
2. Infrastructure Maturity: Coinbase/Kraken and other partners offer institutional-grade custody and compliance.
   1. On-chain identity systems offer a significantly lower cost alternative to traditional KYC/KYB costs
3. Market demand: $19.6B in crypto VC deals (2024) shows appetite for digital-native solutions.&#x20;
   1. The Base L2 ecosystem alone represents $10+ billion in USDC liquidity seeking productive deployment. Capturing even 1% of this market creates a $100 million platform.

#### 12.3 The Vision

Fish Network is building more than a crowdfunding platform. We're creating the operating system for democratized venture capital - infrastructure that will power community-driven investment for decades to come.

A world where:

* Anyone with capital can access world-class deal flow
* Anyone with expertise can build reputation to become a fund manager in the future
* Founders raise from aligned communities, not gatekeepers
* Transparency and fairness replace relationships and opacity
* Small teams building transformative companies find capital fast

#### 12.4 Join Us

Whether you're an investor seeking access to high-quality ventures, a domain expert ready to launch your Fish School, or a founder looking for mission-aligned capital, Fish Network provides the infrastructure to participate in the future of venture capital.

The water's fine. Let's swim together.
