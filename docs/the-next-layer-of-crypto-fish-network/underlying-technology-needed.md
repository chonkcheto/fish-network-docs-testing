# Underlying Technology Needed

**Smart contract platforms** differ from banks/brokerages because the enforcement and record-keeping layer is coded into the protocol; Not run by a company's private ledger.

#### Components Required:

* **Blockchain Layer** (Ethereum, Base, Solana, etc.): Immutable ledger + execution engine.
* **Smart Contracts**: Encoded rule logic (escrow, splits, vesting, voting).
* **Oracles**: Data bridges to pull in off-chain truth (e.g., shipping confirmed, stock price crossed $100).
* **Stablecoins / Crypto Assets**: Capital medium (USDC, ETH).
* **Identity Layer**: KYC/KYB (cb.id, ENS, DID).
* **Custody Layer**: Coinbase Prime / Kraken for regulated storage of assets.

✅ With **Capital One**, these are all siloed internally: a proprietary ledger, a centralized compliance system, and a bank-as-gatekeeper. With **Robinhood**, trade execution is routed through clearinghouses and broker-dealers. None of the logic is transparent or programmable by the user.
