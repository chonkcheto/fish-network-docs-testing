<p align="center">Why does Crypto keep failing?</p>

**The main answer** is integration of crypto chain systems into our current financial infrastructure have been in large part about currency creation, not smart contract creation.

Smart contracts matter more than speculative cryptocurrencies. When capital allocation is structured through programmable rules instead of speculative tokens, entirely new economic structures emerge.

Can we invent new Onchain capital allocation strategies that were not possible before Ethereum, that bring our financial system and our markets into a new era?
