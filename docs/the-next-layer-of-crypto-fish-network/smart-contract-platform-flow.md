# Smart Contract Platform Flow

## Smart Contract Platform Flow:

* **Onboarding:** Connect wallet + pass KYC/KYB.
* **Capital Commit:** Wire USD → convert to USDC/ETH → deposit into smart contract.
* **Rule Setup:** Choose contract template (e.g., "crowdfunding pool," "investment club," "royalty split"). Input parameters: thresholds, timelines, distribution logic.
* **Governance:** Voting dashboards show live proposals, investor weight, and contract execution status.
* **Execution:** When rules are met, the contract automatically routes funds. No manual clearance.
* **Transparency:** Every transaction, vote, and payout is visible on-chain in real time.

**Composable Finance** → Contracts can interact; e.g., a fundraising pool feeding into an investment DAO, which then streams royalties back to contributors.

**Traditional LP Fund (Fiat)**:

* $50k → locked 10 years → $75k–$85k net (median VC fund).
* ROI = \~1.5x after a decade.
* Low liquidity, high fees, GP-driven.
