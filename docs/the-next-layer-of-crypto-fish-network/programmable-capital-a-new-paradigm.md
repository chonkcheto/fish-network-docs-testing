# Programmable Capital: A New Paradigm

### This introduces a new paradigm: **Programmable capital**.

Now instead of "dumb money" that merely moves from one account to another, we gain "intelligent capital" that carries its own logic, restrictions, and pathways. A few examples make this clear:

* **Automated Escrow**: In a real estate deal, funds can be locked in a smart contract that only releases payment once property transfer records are verified on-chain, eliminating title companies and escrow agents.
* **Revenue Sharing Agreements**: Musicians or creators can distribute streaming royalties in real time to dozens of contributors (producers, engineers, rights holders) through a contract that automatically splits incoming payments.
* **Conditional Financing**: Venture investments can be structured so that funds are released in milestones. Instead of wiring $10M upfront, a smart contract disburses tranches as the startup achieves predefined KPIs, with transparency for all stakeholders.
* **Cross-Border Trade**: Smart contracts can handle multi-party agreements across different legal jurisdictions, settling payments instantly once shipping confirmations are verified, without banks needing to reconcile across currencies or time zones.

In each of these cases, the underlying currency could still be fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC — the real unlock isn't the unit of account, but the infrastructure that governs how capital flows.

In traditional fiat systems you own and can move your money — but the **rules that govern how that money is used live outside the money** itself. They live in paperwork, legal systems, or corporate platforms (Stripe, PayPal, ACH).
