# Rule Creation on Crypto Assets

### In a smart contract–based investment/raising platform, rules are part of the asset itself, not external agreements.

_This is where the user experience diverges, dramatically._

#### Imagine, your Bank Account, but with a Library of Functions (rules that can be built on and around it):

* **Access & Governance**
  * Multi-signature approval (e.g., 3 of 5 investors must agree).
  * Weighted voting (based on capital or reputation points).
* **Funding Mechanics**
  * Minimum/maximum raise thresholds (escrow releases only if $1M target hit).
  * Milestone-based disbursement (funds released in stages).
* **Liquidity Rules**
  * Lockup windows (3 weeks, 6 months, 1 year).
  * Redemption rights (withdraw anytime with penalty vs. only after milestone).
* **Distribution Rules**
  * Auto-splits across multiple recipients.
  * Streaming payouts (continuous interest/royalty drip).
* **Compliance Rules**
  * KYC/KYB gating before funds are accepted.
  * Geo-blocking (deny deposits from restricted jurisdictions).

✅ Compare this with Capital One or Robinhood: you don't get to write the rules. You can only use the ones they've predefined — "buy," "sell," "transfer," "schedule a payment."
