# Governing Money (Smart Contract Model)

In a smart contract environment, the rules are embedded directly into the money's movement. The contract doesn't just authorize; it executes.

Examples:

* Escrow without a middleman: Money can be locked into a contract that only releases once both buyer and seller digitally confirm the delivery. No lawyer, no escrow agent, no court.

* Automatic revenue shares: A payment can be coded to automatically split — 50% to you, 30% to a partner, 20% to taxes — with no manual intervention.

* Milestone-based funding: A $1M investment can sit in a contract that releases $200k chunks only when agreed KPIs are uploaded and verified.

Here, the capital is not just waiting for you to push it around. It's carrying instructions, conditions, and governance logic inside itself.
