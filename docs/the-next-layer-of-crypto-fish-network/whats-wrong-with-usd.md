# What's wrong with USD?

**Global markets** using traditional fiat currencies operate in ways that could only be dreamed of a decade ago, all powered by traditional fiat currencies and systems. In order to form a business, become an entrepreneur, or invest in a business, as a standard it comes down to some combination of these: operational accounts, with capital inside them, that can be readily accessed to secure goods and services. Traditional fiat systems not only accomplish this requirement in unbelievable ways all day, they do it over a billion times a day.

Over the past decade traditional fiat systems have only gotten upgrades, taking us further into a future of a well run financial activity (such as CashApp, Stripe, Zelle, Robinhood). Creating new ways our money can be moved, accessed, and what can be possible with our money.

And it all works largely by one simple scaling law: In our current global market fiat systems, the more traditional fiat currency we are allocated, the further our reach within those global market fiat systems.

So what's wrong with USD? What's wrong with Capital One? What's wrong with asset allocation via good ol' US Dollars?

Currency itself is not the problem. Currency is already solved. Dollars, euros, yen, and even fiat-backed digital stablecoins already work exceedingly well as mediums of exchange and stores of value. They benefit from deep regulatory integration, near-universal acceptance, and robust financial infrastructure.

This is why attempts to position crypto tokens as alternative currencies so often falter.  
To function as "money," a system needs three things:

* **Network Effects** — broad adoption across merchants, banks, governments, and individuals.
* **Regulatory Recognition** — legal clarity that ensures the medium is accepted in contracts, settlements, and compliance reporting.
* **Trust & Stability** — confidence that the unit of account will hold value, not fluctuate wildly from one day to the next.

Fiat already dominates on all three fronts with centuries of entrenchment, trillions of daily throughput, and regulatory support at every level.

Crypto tokens, by contrast, have mostly been speculative instruments. Their value often fluctuates more like stocks or commodities than like stable currency.

As a result, crypto has been pushed into the wrong comparison: trying to be "better money" instead of what it is truly good at — **better contracts**.
