# Fish Network - A Paradigm Shift For Retail Investors

## **The Billion Dollar Small Team Era**

Over the past decade, we've seen an accelerating trend: billion-dollar companies being built and scaled by small, hyper-efficient teams. What used to require hundreds of employees, multiple offices, and years of infrastructure can now be accomplished by fewer than a dozen founders and operators.

AI-driven product teams and crypto protocols are positioned to capitalize on this pattern at scale: small squads, plugged into global capital and infrastructure, achieving valuations once reserved for traditional Fortune-500-scale organizations. With a rapidly evolving market economy, founders and investors are choosing tools that empower teams for this new frontier.

Introducing Fish Network. A platform where you can scale entities with almost no operational drag, and investors can exit or reallocate with confidence. Launch, fund, and scale an investment community or venture studio, all while cultivating investor trust and reputation through transparent on-chain systems.

## **Why Current Infrastructure Falls Short In this Era**

Traditional crowdfunding portals are symptomatic of the old model:

* **High costs**: pay-to-list fees and ongoing compliance overhead.
* **Poor match quality**: high-quality issuers avoid the portals, leaving retail investors with limited choice.
* **Investor friction**: decision-making is hampered by lack of transparency and uncertain liquidity.

Crowdfunding portals are founder friendly at the expense of the investor. Investors struggle to make informed decisions, with no control over outcomes, or visibility into real-time progress. Issuers with strong fundamentals avoid portals due to fees (typically 10% of AUM for operating and legal expenses) and ongoing compliance burdens, leaving weaker deals to dominate supply.

This explains why the model hasn't scaled — strong fundamentals avoid it, and investors don't trust it.

## **A Flywheel For The New Economy**

Imagine being able to build your community of aligned founders and investors on auto-pilot, manage personal relationships with ease, source and manage deal flow, all while raising capital within one platform. This infrastructure becomes a flywheel: more startups form, more investors participate, and more liquidity flows through the system, reinforcing a future where economic power is distributed among thousands of small, high-output teams.

## **What Unlocks This New Market Opportunity**

Small teams can achieve outsized outcomes when four layers align:

1. **Market Demand**
   * $19.6B in crypto VC deals (2024) shows appetite for digital-native solutions.
   * The Base L2 ecosystem alone represents $10+ billion in USDC liquidity seeking productive deployment. Capturing even 1% of this market creates a $100 million platform.
1. **Fast Network Formation**
   * On-chain entity formation + compliance tools enables distributed experts, operators, and backers to form instantly, without relying on legacy hiring pipelines.
   * DAOs and on-chain governance create "flash teams" that can form, disband, and reform around high-value opportunities.
   * Streamlined access to institutional-grade custody; on-chain identity solutions offer a lower cost alternative to traditional KYC.
2. **More Effective Capital Raising**
   * Traditional fundraising is fragmented and slow. Issuers burn cycles navigating investor discovery, compliance paperwork, and low-signal conversations.
   * A networked, AI enabled capital formation layer allows retail investors and emerging managers to plug directly into opportunities, transact transparently, and exit with liquidity.
3. **Regulatory Clarity**
   * Reg CF and investment club structure provides a compliant path for community capital formation.
   * Potential for change in US accreditation requirements would streamline retail participation in private markets.

## **The Fish Network Solution**

By leveraging best practices in [On-Chain Capital Allocation](https://allobook.gitcoin.co/), we enable investors to form thesis driven communities, and also enable communities to create turn-key investment vehicles. By leveraging a hybrid funding model, we allow the best startups to compete for immediate access to capital. Fish Network is built specifically for compliant capital formation and represents a set of tools for emerging managers to offer their investors a different set of tradeoffs between liquidity, optionality, and diversification.

**Investment Clubs & Fish Schools:** Fish swim in Structure, Coordination, Direction.

_**Fish School**_ - a hybrid crowdfunding entity for investors, with expert-level research, investor community development, and compliance. Each Fish School has a dedicated Fish School Organizer with expertise in a given field. Fish School Organizers offer support and guidance to investor participants who help select the best startups to be funded.

**Structure:** Investors are organized into community driven Investment Clubs, based on the organizers' expertise. This structure of collective decision making serves two purposes:

1. To further assist with diligence in order to select the most qualified startups via a voting process for each funding campaign.
2. To avoid the General Partner, and Financial Advisor liabilities by relying on collective decision making, which also helps reduce operational costs.

Additionally, The Fish Network offers investors an interactive & social voting experience, using reward reputation points(FISH points), which helps investors build their network, portfolio, and track record on-chain.

_**Coordination:**_ A Fish School Organizer will be appointed in each newly formed LLC(i.e. Fish School).

* To provide accountability over the formation of the LLC, including SEC registration via Form C, and sourcing of accounting, legal, and admin services.
* To spearhead the business development & startup screening process; facilitating the funding of the startups competing for a portion of the funds raised.

Each Fish School has an escrow + qualified custody account created by the organizer, to safeguard the capital from the moment it was contributed by Investors, to the moment it is distributed to the winning startup.

_**Direction:**_ The Fish School Organizers are responsible for orchestrating the submission, review, and vetting processes for the best-qualified startups competing for funds. Organizers provide the initial thesis thought leadership, and continued support in distributing the funds to the startup and future redemption of shares, USDC, and FISH points to the investors; in exchange for an agreed upon commission from the Fish School and/or Fish Network Treasury.

**What's different:** Capital is pooled up‑front, diligence is community‑driven, liquidity is coordinated across organizations; admin is a streamlined experience handled via KYC/KYB and qualified custody.

**Go-to-Market Approach:**

The Fish Network provides a platform to effectively find and capitalize the best startups building on top of Coinbase's L2, the [BASE Network](https://www.base.org/), as well as other similarly situated technologies and investor communities. Leveraging Coinbase's L2 BASE, identity verification, custody, and business accounts services, we are able to provide issuers with a comprehensive software, legal, and operational framework for raising capital. Altogether, on-chain primitives are utilized to reduce the cost of doing business, and will allow new investors to seamlessly connect to our investor ecosystem through a trusted medium.

## Roles on Fish Network

The Fish Network hosts a platform of Fish Schools, organized by vetted, qualified Fish School Organizers, to give investors optionality to join other differentiated investment communities. Currently, Fish School Organizers undergo a rigorous vetting process to ensure we meet our investor's expectations. In the future, anyone will be able to launch a Fish School seamlessly.

## Product Roadmap

Fish Network is a compliant, semi‑liquid platform that turns thesis‑driven investment clubs ("Fish Schools") into AI‑enabled, tokenized micro‑funds with future shared liquidity. We introduce a minimum 1-year lockup structure for investors in "venture fund" Fish Schools, which is typically 7-10 years for investors in a "traditional" venture fund. This enables emerging managers to move at the speed of technology; raising and deploying funds fully on-chain, while giving investors optionality to re-allocate quickly.

#### Option A -  Fish School Structure — "50/40/10 Split" (venture club)

Investors overcollateralize with USDC to maintain liquidity optionality after initial results.

* **50%** to FishLP Contract (USDC) to accrue Fish Points and interest to enable future shared liquidity for Fish Schools.
* **40%** allocated to escrow for mandatory 21‑day voting window until deployed to voted‑in startups.
* **10%** to school treasury for ops, insurance, admin fees, etc.

#### Option B -  Fish School Structure — "50/40/10 Split" (hybrid venture + liquid club)

Fish School holds a liquid reserve asset or an actively managed portfolio.

* **50%** to Fish School custodial account to be deployed into liquid assets
* **40%** allocated to escrow for mandatory 21‑day voting window until deployed to voted‑in startups.
* **10%** to school treasury for ops, insurance, admin fees, etc.
  
### Fees & Liquidity

* **Lockups:** Default **3‑week** post‑deposit window; some schools may set **up to 1 year**.
* **Shared Liquidity:** Synthetic exposure to illiquid assets, collateralized by liquid crypto; cross‑school redemption support.

*The **"50/40/10 Split"** Fish School structure is a **future, optional liquidity model under exploration only** and **is not active or available in the live product today.** Any references to 50/40/10 should be read as roadmap concepts, subject to further legal, technical, and market validation.*

## Risks & Mitigations

* **Regulatory clarity:** Pre‑vetted club legal docs; escalation path via registered broker-dealers and B2B partnerships. Compliance powered via established crypto infra(qualified custody, KYC/KYB identity primitives).
* **Liquidity bootstrapping:** Initial Fish Schools raising sufficient capital; target professional emerging managers
* **Manager quality:** Rigorous Organizer vetting; Shoal Leader QA and shared services.

## **Market Growth Vectors:**

The Fish Network is poised to unlock tremendous value for the individual investor by leveling the playing field in venture capital.

**1) Reg A+.** Once the crowdfunding market is captured, we have the ability to expand into Reg A+ offerings above $5M.

**2) New Asset Classes:** Initially we are targeting the venture capital market; this model can be extended to any illiquid asset class where investors may want liquidity optionality.

**3) Crypto Native Funds:** Fish Schools should have the ability to pursue more crypto native investment strategies, such as holding ETH instead of USDC in reserve. However, we have designed the Fish Network to be insulated from most crypto market risks.

**4) Institutional Investor Adoption:** At scale, Fish Network unlocks a fund of funds model enabling investors to receive diversified exposure to all of the Fish Schools, with minimal crypto-native risk exposure. This could unlock large pools of capital comfortable with the Coinbase & Kraken ecosystems.


## Conclusion

The Fish Network flips the syndicate & crowdfunding model on its head. Instead of chasing investors for each deal, when most of them drop out anyway, we introduce a new capital deployment model, where the capital has already been locked in smart contract escrow. Rather than using a traditional SPV, we introduce the concept of a Fish School, where any community can launch an investment club to better serve their constituents.

The investment model for Fish Schools is inherently sector agnostic. Investment Clubs can be leveraged by investors with little to no crypto risk exposure, utilizing USDC to facilitate liquidity. With various Fish Schools investing into different verticals, the end state becomes an open crowdfunding platform like [Start Engine](https://www.startengine.com/), but the backend of the platform is delivered leveraging smart contracts, voting processes, and transparent reward mechanisms.

![Fish Network Platform](static/img/gitbook/generated-image-september.png)

Investors can easily commit USDC and ETH directly to the startups that are presenting with the click of a button. However, in order to receive reputation points(Fish Points), contributors must invest into the Fish School beforehand. This gives investors the optionality to deploy behind trusted organizers, trust their gut, or leverage the wisdom of the crowd through Fish Schools. Fish Network creates a competitive advantage for emerging managers, all while providing much needed capital support to the best early stage founders.
