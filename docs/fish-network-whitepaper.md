# Fish Network Whitepaper

Version 1.0 | December 2025

---

### Executive Summary

Fish Network is reimagining early-stage capital formation by replacing inefficient centralized crowdfunding portals with decentralized Fish Schools - community-driven investment clubs that combine expert curation with collective decision-making, all powered by blockchain infrastructure.

As communities scale, governance and diligence become the bottleneck. Fish AI Agents convert passive investors into active contributors by compressing diligence time, organizing discussions, and enabling voice-confirmed voting—improving decision quality while keeping the system squarely within the parameters of an SEC recognized investment club.

#### The Problem

Traditional crowdfunding platforms charge excessive fees (up to 10% of assets under management), suffer from adverse selection as high-quality companies avoid them, and offer investors little liquidity or transparency. Meanwhile, venture capital remains concentrated among a small number of firms, limiting access for both investors and founders.

#### Our Solution

Fish Network enables investors to form thesis-driven communities called Fish Schools - legally compliant investment clubs where capital is pooled upfront, startups compete for funding through community votes, and transparency is enforced through smart contracts on Coinbase's Base Layer 2 blockchain.

#### Agentic AI Layer

Fish Network includes an agentic AI layer that reduces participation friction while preserving investment-club requirements for active member involvement. Voice and chat-based assistants help members review opportunities, ask questions, and cast consent-based votes; social distribution agents help Fish School Organizers communicate thesis, updates, and due diligence to existing communities without general solicitation. The AI layer is designed to increase informed participation—not replace individual decision-making.

#### Key Innovation

Unlike traditional syndicate models where investors commit per deal, Fish Schools operate with pre-funded capital pools. This eliminates deal-by-deal friction, ensures serious commitment, and allows organizers to move quickly when opportunities arise. This provides investors with a more capital efficient deployment mechanism, that can help facilitate any type of social capital formation.

#### Market Opportunity

With over $10 billion in USDC on the Base network alone, Fish Network targets just 1% market penetration to achieve $100 million in Total Value Locked. As the billion-dollar small team era accelerates, efficient capital formation infrastructure becomes critical for both founders and investors.

#### Vision

Today, Fish Network provides the comprehensive framework for emerging managers to scale US based community-driven venture capital. Tomorrow, Fish Network has the opportunity to become the global operating system for democratized early-stage investing, designed for the average retail investor. By providing a different set of tradeoffs between **liquidity, optionality, and diversification**, Fish Network provides global access to US private markets using transparent and compliant on-chain systems, coupled with existing custody and identity verification solutions.
