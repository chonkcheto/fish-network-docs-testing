# The Fish School Advantage

The Fish Network is a compliant, semi‑liquid platform that turns thesis‑driven investment clubs into software‑enabled, tokenized micro‑funds with shared liquidity.

Investors can easily commit USDC and ETH directly to the startups that are presenting with the click of a button. However, in order to receive reputation points(Fish Points), contributors must invest into the Fish School beforehand. This gives investors the optionality to trust their gut or leverage the wisdom of the crowd.

**What's different:** Capital is pooled up‑front, Diligence is community‑driven, Liquidity is coordinated across organizations, and admin is a streamlined experience handled via KYC/KYB and qualified custody.

Compliance powered via established crypto infra (KYC/KYB, qualified custody, identity primitives).

Fish Network is built specifically for compliant capital formation and represents a set of tools for emerging managers to offer their investors a different set of tradeoffs between liquidity, optionality, and diversification.

The investment model for Fish Schools is inherently sector agnostic. Investment Clubs can be leveraged by investors with little to no crypto risk exposure, utilizing USDC to facilitate liquidity. With various Fish Schools investing into different verticals, the end state becomes an open crowdfunding platform like [Start Engine](https://www.startengine.com/), but the backend of the platform is delivered leveraging smart contracts, voting processes, and transparent reward mechanisms.
