# Current Landscape in Funding Early Stage Ventures

Traditional crowdfunding portals are plagued with inefficiencies and bloated cost models:

* **High costs**: pay-to-list fees and ongoing compliance overhead. Web2 Unit Economics are $2-4 per individual investor KYC
  * **Why Fish Network Wins**: web3 Unit Economics are \~0$ per investor KYC by building on (almost) free web3 developer tooling. Compliance is built into the investment agreement.<br>
* **Poor match quality**: high-quality issuers avoid the portals, leaving lower-signal deals to dominate.
  * **Why Fish Network Wins**: Investors are organized into theme specific Fish Schools, allowing people to collaborate and invest around shared interests.<br>
* **Investor friction**: decision-making is hampered by lack of transparency and uncertain liquidity.
  * **Why Fish Network Wins**: Investors are organized into investment clubs, streamlining accessibility to non-accredited investors.
